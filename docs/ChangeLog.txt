   now linked to this typedef.
** Base Units.ctl  >>> an enum typedef for base units as described 
   in App Note 154 
** Physical Units.ctl >>> a cluster of {Base Unit, Exponent}

* Added VIs:
** Array Dim(s) from TD.vi >>> we had only one with variant input.
** Get Element TD from Array TD.vi >>> we had only one with 
   variant input.
** Get Physical Units from TD.vi >>> outputs an array of Physical 
   Units each base unit with its exponent
** Get Physical Units.vi >>> same as previous except for variant 
   input.
